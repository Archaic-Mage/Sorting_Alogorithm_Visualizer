# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer to comprehend the similarities between all the sorting algorithms. 

5 algorithms ranging from worst time complexity to best. The following algorithms are
included:
- Bubble Sort (time complexity: O(n^2)
- Heap Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n))
- Merge Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n))
- Quick Sort (time complexity: O(nlog(n))
- Radix Sort (time complexity: O(nk)) -> k = Amount of Digits in the value inside array with the largest amount of digits
